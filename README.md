# Lucian-s-Lasagna
An Exercism Exercise in JavaScript

create a time management program /[program to manage time] 

* Every thing is calculated in minutes
givens include:
* EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN = 40
* remainingMinutesInOven 
* preparationTimeInMinutes
* each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare
* totalTimeInMinutes
* numberOfLayers
* actualMinutesInOven

Tasks to create and master:
1 ) Define Oven time for meal
-How much time is expeected to cook this meal?
-Is this constant or will this time vary?
-Should this number be used in other functiond?

2 ) Calculate remaining oven time 
-Whats the bondaries?
-What do ew expect for output?
GOAL: function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter and returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the expected oven time in minutes from the previous task
3 ) calculate prep time
-How much time is expected to prepin total?
-Why did we chose our parameers?

4 ) Calculate working time total
-

5 ) WriteUp what you found while exploring?
-Why were these concepts worthy of the firt problem solving lesson?
-How has my undestanding changed?



GIVEN CODE SAMPLES:

remainingMinutesInOven(30);
// => 10

preparationTimeInMinutes(2);
// => 4

totalTimeInMinutes(3, 20);
// => 26
